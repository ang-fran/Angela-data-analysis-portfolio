## About

I am a graduate researcher with a focus on time series analysis and econometric modeling.
My work centers on both theoretical and applied aspects of univariate and multivariate
time series models, including autoregressive processes, VAR models, and Markov-switching
frameworks.  

This portfolio highlights projects developed through thesis research, coursework,
and teaching experience.
